This enumeration is used to determine the type a Matrix.
Possible values are:
	- euler: matrix used to find absolute positions from the position inside the solid using Euler's angles.
	- antieuler: the inverse of euler.
	- rotation: matrix representing the rotation to apply to the solid.
	.
This enumeration is used in one of the constructors (Matrix(Psi, Theta, Phi, Type)) of class Matrix.

Constructs a Matrix instance starting from three angles and the type. if Type is euler or antieuler, the angles are the
Euler's angles. If Type is rotation, the values have a somewhat different meaning: they are the angles rotation describing
the rotation applid to a solid; the result ing matrix is then multiplied by the current "euler" matrix to give th new euler
matrix.
The code used in CrystalView::Rotate and in GtkChem3DViewer code is (when mouse has moved by x and y on the screen):
\code

	Matrix Mat(0, (y > 0)? - acos(x/z) :acos(x/z), z * M_PI / 90., rotation);
	m_Euler = Mat * m_Euler;
