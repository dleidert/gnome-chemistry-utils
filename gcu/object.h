This enumeration is used to determine the type of an Object instance.
Possible values are:
	- AtomType: an atom
	- FragmentType: several atoms linked and represented by a text such as COOH (only in GChemPaint).
	- BondType: a bond between two (or more) atoms.
	- MoleculeType: a molecule.
	- ChainType: a chain of atoms (only in GChemPaint)
	- CycleType: a cycle (only in GChemPaint)
	- ReactantType: a molecule involved in a reaction (only in GChemPaint).
	- ReactionArrowType: a reaction arrow (only in GChemPaint).
	- ReactionOperatorType: a + sign in a reaction (only in GChemPaint).
	- ReactionType: a reaction.
	- MesomeryType: a mesomery representation (only in GChemPaint).
	- MesomeryArrowType: a double headed arrow used to represent mesomery (only in GChemPaint).
	- DocumentType: a document, generally the top node in the objects tree.
	- TextType: some text (only in GChemPaint).
	- OtherType: if the type of an object is at least equal to OtherType, then it is a dynamically created type returned
	by the static Object::AddType method.
	.
Some types are not used in  the Gnome Chemistry Utils, but only in GChemPaint
and might disappear from this list in future versions and replaced by dynamically created types.
