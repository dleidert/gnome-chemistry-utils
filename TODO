* Periodic table:
	* add more data using bodr.
	* add crystal structures.
	* allow plotting any property againt another one, i.e. ei vs vdw radius.
	* allow charts customization (needs a new dalog, goffice one being
	unusable in this context).
	* write help.

* Calculator:
	* accept abbreviations as Ph and others (what about Ac, Pr,...?).

* 3d viewer:
	* export encapsulated postscript.
	* allow selection of atoms and or bonds, and display or lengths and angles.

* Mozilla plugin:
	* implement printing.
	* support 2d rendering (using gchempaint).

* Gnome Crystal:
	* finish cif file import.
	* open cml files using openbabel.
	* export to  cif and cml formats.

	* enhance copy-and-paste support for OpenOffice.org.
	* plugin to prepare png files of molecules ready for publication in wikipedia (almost done).
	* Use a cairo based canvas (0.10? if gtk+ permits).
	* New tools:
		- delocalized bonds (?),
		- week interactions (e.g. H-bonds) (?),
		- curved arrows (in mechanisms) (?).
		- curved reaction arrows and Tollman's loops (?),
		- cluster bonds (as in boranes) (?),
		- electron vacancies (?).
	* Multi-steps reactions (?).
	* Scriptability (?).
	* Enhance selection (?).
	* Add abbreviations in fragments (0.10?).
	* Enhance fragments (0.10?).
	* Change cursor according to situation (?).
	* Allow associating various objects with reaction arrows (0.10).

* Goffice component:
