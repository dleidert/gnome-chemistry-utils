\brief the list of reactants before or after a reaction arrow.

The ReactionStep class is a group class which owns a list of reactants and
the operators betwwen them. This class is misnamed, since the step is more
generally associated with the arrow. It might be renamed ReactionStage in the
future if it is possible without making old files unreadable.
