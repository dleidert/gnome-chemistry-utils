\brief Chemical reaction class.

This class is used for chemical reactions in GChemPaint. It can represent a
whole reactions scheme with several steps, although only one step is currently
really supported. Acceptable children for an instance of this class are
instances of ReactionArrow and ReactionStep.

This method is called to build a reactiont from its children. It might fail if

children are molecules and texts to be used as reactants or products, and
reaction arrows.
