\brief the base class for objects associated with a canvas item.

The ItemClient class is a base class used to associate document objects to items
in the canvas. The associated item might be a Group, and the client might be
registered for all group children. If several items are associated to the same
object, the m_Item member should be the toplevel group. Destroying an
ItemClient instance will destroy the item.
