This enumeration is used to determine the type a Matrix.

Constructs a Matrix instance starting from three angles and the type. if Type is euler or antieuler, the angles are the
Euler's angles. If Type is rotation, the values have a somewhat different meaning: they are the angles describing
the rotation applied to a solid; the resulting matrix is then multiplied by the current "euler" matrix to give the new euler
matrix.
The code used in CrystalView::Rotate and in GtkChem3DViewer code is (when mouse has moved by x and y on the screen):
\code

	Matrix Mat(0, (y > 0)? - acos(x/z) :acos(x/z), z * M_PI / 90., rotation);
	m_Euler = Mat * m_Euler;
