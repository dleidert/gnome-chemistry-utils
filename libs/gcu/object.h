Possible values are:

	- BondType a bond between two (or more) atoms.
	- MoleculeType a molecule.

	- CycleType a cycle.
	- ReactantType a molecule involved in a reaction (only in GChemPaint).
	- ReactionArrowType a reaction arrow (only in GChemPaint).
	- ReactionOperatorType a + sign in a reaction (only in GChemPaint).
	- ReactionType a reaction.
	- MesomeryType a mesomery representation (only in GChemPaint).
	- MesomeryArrowType a double headed arrow used to represent mesomery (only in GChemPaint).
	- DocumentType a document, generally the top node in the objects tree.
	- TextType some text (only in GChemPaint).
	- OtherType if the type of an object is at least equal to OtherType, then it is a dynamically created type returned
	by the static Object::AddType method.

Some types are not used in  the Gnome Chemistry Utils, but only in GChemPaint
