Helper method used to search the xmlNode instance of name Name and with id property equal to id
in the children of node. When id is NULL, the searched node does not have an id property.
When id is not NULL, the searched node should be unique.

@param y: a pointer to the y coordinate of the position.
@param z: a pointer to the z coordinate of the position or NULL for 2D objects.

This method can be used to load the coordinates of a point in an Object instance. It should be used in cunjunction with WritePosition() which
executes the inverse operation. If id is NULL, a position with no id property will be search and parsed.
