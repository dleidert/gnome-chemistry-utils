Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latest version of the software can be found at:
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/gchemutils/
See the file ChangeLog for more information about this software.

What is needed to install the Gnome Chemistry Utils:
	GtkGLExt version 1.0.0 or later.
	GOffice version 0.8.x.
	All dependencies of these libraries.
These libraries are available from ftp://ftp.gnome.org or one of its mirrors.
	BODR (the Blue Obelisk Data Repository) version 5 or later.
		(http://bodr.sourceforge.net).
	The Chemical Mime Data version 0.1.94 or later
		(http://chemical-mime.sourceforge.net).
	OpenBabel-2 version 2.1.0 or later (http://openbabel.sourceforge.net).

Further man, xmllint, xsltproc and maybe a local docbook-xsl installation
are required for manpage building. We deliver ready-to-use manpages, so you
don't need to build them yourself. But if you e.g. change something in their
XML source, you need xsltproc to update the manpages too.

Versions numbering:
Odd minor versions are development version. To see what remains to be done
before a stable version can be released read the TODO file. Help is of course
welcomed.

Five widgets are present in this version of the software:
* GcukPeriodic is a periodic table of the elements.
* GcuComboPeriodic is a combo button with a drop down
periodic table.
* GcuCrystalViewer is a crystal structure viewer.
* GcuChem3DViewer is a 3D molecular structure viewer.
* GcuSpectrumViewer is a spectrum viewer.
Simple samples of their use are provided in the test programs

Six programs are avaible:
* A 2D chemical editor (GChemPaint).
* A 3D molecular structure viewer (GChem3Viewer).
* A Crystal structure viewer (GCrystal).
* A Chemical calculator (GChemCalc).
* A Spectrum viewer (GSpectrum).
* A periodic table of the elements application (GChemTable).

Three plugins for external programs are included:
* A GOffice plugin allows embedding GChemPaint supported files in programs
supporting the GOffice component framework (Abiword is the only one none).
* A Gnumeric plugin provides a molarmass function for the spreadsheet.
* A Mozilla plugin allows embedding 2D, 3D and crystal structures as well as
spectra in web pages.
