Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latest version of the software can be found at:
	http://jean.brefort.free.fr/info/gcu/download/
See the file Changes for more information about this software.

What is needed to install the Gnome Chemistry Utils:
	liblade-2
	GtkGLArea-2 of GtkGLExt
	All dependencies of these two libraries
	OpenBabel for the GtkChem3DViewer
These libraries are available from ftp://ftp.gnome.org or one of its mirrors

Note that the Gnome Chemistry Utils will build even without both GtkGLArea-2 and GtkGLExt
but, in that case, the GtkCrystalViewer and GtkChem3DViewer widgets will not be built.
If OpenBabel is not present or not dectected by configure, the GtkChem3DViewer widget
will not be built. You need a compiled OpenBabel source tree and give
--with-openbabel=path_to_your openbabel_tree to configure.

Versions numbering:
Odd minor versions are development version. To see what remains to be done
before a stable version can be released read the TODO file. Help is of course
welcomed.

Three widgets are present in this version of the software:
* GtkPeriodic is a periodic table of the elements.
* GtkCrystalViewer is a crystal structure viewer.
* GtkChem3DViewer is a 3D molecular structure viewer. It is also available as a
Bonobo Control.
Simple samples of their use is provided in the test programs

Please, note that GtkCrystalViewer cannot use files created with Gnome Crystal
versions smaller than 0.5. The sample file is indented, but files created by Gnome Crystal
are written on a single line (using libxml2).
