Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latest version of the software can be found at:
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/gchemutils/
See the file ChangeLog for more information about this software.

What is needed to install the Gnome Chemistry Utils:
	libglade-2 version 2.4.0 or later.
	libgnomeprintui-2.2 version 2.4.0 or later.
	GtkGLExt version 1.0.0 or later.
	GOffice version 0.4.x.
	All dependencies of these libraries.
These libraries are available from ftp://ftp.gnome.org or one of its mirrors.
	BODR (the Blue Obelisk Data Repository) version 5 or later.
		(http://bodr.sourceforge.net).
	The Chemical Mime Data version 0.1.94 or later
		(http://chemical-mime.sourceforge.net).
	OpenBabel-2 version 2.1.x (http://openbabel.sourceforge.net).

Further man, xmllint, xsltproc and maybe a local docbook-xsl installation
are required for manpage building. We deliver ready-to-use manpages, so you
don't need to build them yourself. But if you e.g. change something in their
XML source, you need xsltproc to update the manpages too.

Versions numbering:
Odd minor versions are development version. To see what remains to be done
before a stable version can be released read the TODO file. Help is of course
welcomed.

Four widgets are present in this version of the software:
* GtkPeriodic is a periodic table of the elements.
* GtkComboPeriodic is a combo button with a drop down
periodic table.
* GtkCrystalViewer is a crystal structure viewer.
* GtkChem3DViewer is a 3D molecular structure viewer.
Simple samples of their use are provided in the test programs

Four programs are avaible:
* A 3D molecular structure viewer (GChem3Viewer).
* A Crystal structure viewer (GCrystal).
* A Chemical calculator (GChemCalc).
* A periodic table of the elements application (GChemTable).
